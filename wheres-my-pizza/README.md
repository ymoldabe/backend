## Learning Objectives

- Message Queue Systems
- RabbitMQ Integration
- Concurrent Programming

## Abstract

In this project, you will build a restaurant order management system using RabbitMQ as a message broker. The system simulates a real restaurant workflow where orders go through various processing stages: received -> cooking -> ready -> delivered.

Similar systems are used in real restaurants and food delivery services. For example, when you order food through an app, your order goes through an analogous processing system with task distribution among different staff members.

This project will teach you that before you start writing code, you should think through the system architecture, understand how components will interact, and only then proceed to implementation.

## Context

> you canâ€™t polish your way out of bad architecture
>

The challenge we've chosen may seem unique, but at its core lies the common structure of many other distributed systems: data comes in, gets processed by various components, and is passed along the chain.

Our specific task is to create a reliable order processing system that can scale horizontally. If we simply processed orders sequentially in a single thread, the system would quickly become a bottleneck as load increases.

To achieve more efficient results, we need a distributed architecture with separation of concerns, where each component performs its specific function.

**Message Queue Patterns**

A smart way to solve this type of problem is using message queue patterns. This approach views the system as a set of interacting services, where each service processes a specific type of message and passes the result further down the chain.

**Work Queue Pattern**
- One producer sends tasks to a queue
- Multiple consumers compete to receive tasks
- Each task is processed by exactly one consumer
- Provides load distribution among workers

**Publish/Subscribe Pattern**
- One publisher sends messages to all subscribers
- Multiple consumers receive copies of messages
- Used for notifications and state synchronization

**Routing Pattern**
- Messages are routed based on routing key
- Allows creating complex processing schemes
- Provides flexibility in defining recipients

Order processing algorithm using queues:

```
1. Client places order through API
2. Order is placed in kitchen_queue
3. Available cook takes order from queue
4. After cooking, order is directed to quality_queue
5. Quality controller checks the order
6. Ready order is placed in packaging_queue
7. Packager prepares order for delivery
8. Order is directed to courier through delivery_queue
9. All interested parties receive status notifications
```

**Data Structure and Architecture**

Let's consider our program requirements. We aim to process hundreds of orders simultaneously, support multiple workers, and ensure response times in seconds, not minutes. At this scale, we cannot afford inefficient algorithms or architecture.

The order processing workflow requires coordination between multiple components. This means we need a smart way to organize interaction between services. We're looking for a structure that can efficiently represent order state and its transitions between stages.

Our program will work in microservice mode: each component (cook, quality controller, packager, courier) works independently but is coordinated through RabbitMQ. Each service must quickly receive appropriate tasks and send results further down the chain.

Let's call the combination of an order and its current state a "processing stage" - this is a common term in workflow systems. We'll need to track transitions between stages and ensure reliable message delivery.

This approach gives us a clear path forward. By focusing on these key requirements, we can design a solution that is both elegant and efficient.

Subscribed to order notifications
Received: Order ORD_001 status changed to 'cooking' at 2024-12-16 10:30:15
Received: Order ORD_001 status changed to 'ready' at 2024-12-16 10:40:20

# Check order status via API
$ curl http://localhost:3000/orders/ORD_001/status
{"order_id": "ORD_001", "status": "ready", "updated_at": "2024-12-16T10:40:20Z"}

      {"name": "Pizza", "quantity": 3, "price": 15.99},
      {"name": "Salad", "quantity": 2, "price": 8.99}
    ]
  }'

Response: {"order_id": "ORD_003", "priority": 5, "status": "received"}

# Cook receives orders by priority
$ ./restaurant-system --mode=kitchen-worker --worker-id="chef_mario"

## Support

If you get stuck, test your code with the example inputs from the project. You should get the same results. If not, re-read the description again. Perhaps you missed something, or your code is incorrect.

Make sure the RabbitMQ server is running and accessible. Check the connection to RabbitMQ and proper configuration of queues and exchanges.

If you're still stuck, ask a friend for help or take a break and come back later.

## Guidelines from Author

Before diving into code, it's crucial to step back and think about your system architecture. This project illustrates a fundamental principle of good software design - your architectural choices often determine the clarity and efficiency of your code.

Start with questions: How will components interact? Which message exchange patterns best fit the task? What delivery guarantees are needed? Only after you've carefully thought through these questions should you proceed to API design and code writing.

This approach may seem like extra work initially, but it pays off. Well-chosen architecture can make your code simpler, more readable, and often more efficient. It's like choosing the right tools before starting work - with the right foundation, the rest of the work becomes much easier.

Remember that in programming, as in many other things, thoughtful preparation is the key to success. Spend time on proper architecture, and you'll find that the coding process becomes smoother and more enjoyable.

Good system architecture is the foundation of clear, efficient code. It often simplifies programming more than clever algorithms can. Invest time in architectural design first. This approach usually leads to more maintainable and understandable programs, regardless of their size or complexity.
