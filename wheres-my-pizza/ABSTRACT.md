## Learning Objectives

- Message Queue Systems
- RabbitMQ Integration
- Concurrent Programming

## Abstract

In this project, you will build a restaurant order management system using RabbitMQ as a message broker. The system simulates a real restaurant workflow where orders go through various processing stages: received -> cooking -> ready -> delivered.

Similar systems are used in real restaurants and food delivery services. For example, when you order food through an app, your order goes through an analogous processing system with task distribution among different staff members.

This project will teach you that before you start writing code, you should think through the system architecture, understand how components will interact, and only then proceed to implementation.
